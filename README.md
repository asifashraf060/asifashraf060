**`Earth Science || Physics || Computer Science`**

PhD candidate in Geophysics at the University of Oregon, working at the intersection of seismic imaging, machine learning, and high-performance computing. My research broadly revolves around **imaging and sensing the Earth**‚Äîfrom crustal structure to subduction zone dynamics.

## üî¨ Working On

- **High-Resolution Seismic Tomography**: Developing 3-D, shore-crossing tomographic model of the Cascadia Subduction Zone, using ship-borne wide-angle seismic refraction arrivals. I invert for P-wave velocity structure to understand tectonic processes at depth.
    - Built an end-to-end synthetic 3-D velocity model generator that integrates tectonic and geologic features.
    - Designed techniques to extract fine-scale features from tomography, linking them to subduction zone dynamics.
      
- **Machine Learning for Seismology**: Building a deep-learning phase picker tailored for active-source seismic data.
    - Uses Bayesian uncertainty quantification so the model can abstain when traces are too noisy.
    - Part of a broader effort to bring trustworthy ML into seismic processing workflows.
      
- **Other Projects**: Beyond tomography and ML, I contribute to projects on gravity‚Äìmagnetic modeling, Moho geometry, and seismic attenuation, with applications across Cascadia and beyond.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools of the Trade

- **Programming/Data**: Python (ObsPy, NumPy, SciPy, Dask, PyTorch, ...), MATLAB, Julia, Bash
- **HPC/Cloud**: SLURM based HPC, AWS (instances, S3, Boto3 for access, MongoDB/DynamoDB)
- **Visualization & Modeling**: Geosoft, OpendTect, Petrel, ArcGIS, QGIS
- **Instrumentation**: Seismometers (nodal & OBS), magnetometers, resistivity & GPR systems

## üìÑ Summary

- üåé My research spans seismic tomography, ML-based phase picking, and potential-field modeling.
- üõ∞Ô∏è I enjoy building scalable pipelines that bridge field data ‚Üí HPC inversion ‚Üí interpretable geophysical products.
- ‚úçÔ∏è You can find my publications in *JGR: Solid Earth, Tectonophysics, G-cubed*, and more
